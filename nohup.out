Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['project_hid.weight', 'project_q.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'project_q.weight', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight', 'project_hid.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: path, split, Speaker_name. If path, split, Speaker_name are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['project_q.bias', 'project_q.weight', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight', 'project_hid.weight', 'project_hid.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Count, Speaker_gender, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_age_at_recording, gender_age_group, Speaker_name, path. If Count, Speaker_gender, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_age_at_recording, gender_age_group, Speaker_name, path are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias']

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['project_hid.weight', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight', 'project_q.bias', 'project_hid.bias', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'project_q.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Speaker_name, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_age_at_recording, path, Speaker_gender, Count. If Speaker_name, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_age_at_recording, path, Speaker_gender, Count are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['project_hid.bias', 'project_q.bias', 'project_q.weight', 'project_hid.weight', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Speaker_age_at_recording, Speaker_gender, Count, Speaker_name, path, Speaker_age_group. If Speaker_age_at_recording, Speaker_gender, Count, Speaker_name, path, Speaker_age_group are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['project_hid.weight', 'project_q.weight', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'project_q.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias', 'project_hid.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-slavic-voxpopuli-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight', 'classifier.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Speaker_name, Speaker_age_at_recording, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_gender, path, Count. If Speaker_name, Speaker_age_at_recording, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_gender, path, Count are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
