Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: path, Speaker_gender. If path, Speaker_gender are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: path, Speaker_gender. If path, Speaker_gender are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

loading weights file https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin from cache at /home/peterr/.cache/huggingface/transformers/096a02dd6829673a581dd6bd411bde326ca2a6808b9c6c156400c45db0710905.66e60aa700a89184cf81f564c0cab7380c4d37a91b35e84bb68ed0aa98eae2d2
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Speaker_name, path, split. If Speaker_name, path, split are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Speaker_name, path, split. If Speaker_name, path, split are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

loading weights file https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin from cache at /home/peterr/.cache/huggingface/transformers/096a02dd6829673a581dd6bd411bde326ca2a6808b9c6c156400c45db0710905.66e60aa700a89184cf81f564c0cab7380c4d37a91b35e84bb68ed0aa98eae2d2
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification: ['lm_head.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
Using amp half precision backend
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Speaker_gender, path, Speaker_age_at_recording, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_name, Count. If Speaker_gender, path, Speaker_age_at_recording, Speaker_age_group, Speaker_name, Count are not expected by `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
